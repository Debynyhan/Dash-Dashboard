# Dash Dashboard
I carefully examine the specifications, seek clarification as needed, and divide the issue into more manageable tasks. I look into related issues or potential solutions, research the required tools and technologies, and gain knowledge from the documentation and resources already available. Furthermore I create a high-level plan, list the modules or components, and sketch out a rough solution design.
The database interaction code for the CRUD module can be reused across various projects or components.
The overall structure is simpler to comprehend and maintain by separating the dashboard code from the database logic.
Before integrating the CRUD module with other components, the database interaction code can be tested independently of the dashboard to make sure it is functioning properly.
Only the CRUD module needs to be updated if the database technology or schema changes, minimizing the impact on the rest of the project.
